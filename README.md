# doublecram-solver
A solver for an impartial combinatorial game.

[Cram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram_(game)) is played on a square grid using 2x1 dominoes. Players alternate placing a domino in any free space; 
the first player who cannot play loses.

Doublecram is the same game, played with 2x2 dominoes.  For even-sized boards the first player wins with a symmetric strategy mirroring the other player's moves,
after first occupying the center board.
